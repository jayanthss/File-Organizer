# 🗂️ File Organizer using Python

This project is a simple Python script that **automatically arranges files** in your working directory into separate folders based on their file type (extension).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Organizes all files (like `.txt`, `.py`, `.jpg`, etc.) into their respective folders  
- Keeps your workspace clean and structured  
- Skips the main script file to avoid moving it  
- Easy to understand and modify for beginners  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The script checks all files in the current folder.

2. It reads the file extension (like .py, .txt, .jpg).

3. It creates a folder for that extension (if not already present).

4. Then it moves the file into that folder automatically.
